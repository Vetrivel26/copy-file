Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, 
and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[33] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features,
such as list comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system (in addition to reference counting). 
Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. 
Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
